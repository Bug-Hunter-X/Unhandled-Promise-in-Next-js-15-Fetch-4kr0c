# Unhandled Promise in Next.js 15 Fetch

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications involving unhandled promises when fetching data within components.  Improper handling of promises from `fetch` or other asynchronous operations can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the client-side rendering.

The `about.js` file shows the problematic code.  The solution in `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates how to correctly handle promises using `async/await`.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll see that the data is not correctly displayed because the promise object is logged instead of the resolved data.

## Solution

The correct solution uses `async/await` to gracefully handle the promise, ensuring that the actual data is logged and displayed.
